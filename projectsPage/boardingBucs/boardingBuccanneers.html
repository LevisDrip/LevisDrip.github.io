                <p class="aboutmefont">Boarding Buccaneers was made as an extra for a game development assignment.
                During this time we didn't actually get any good explanations on how the code worked and what everything
                did, so I had to ask for help from friends and look up things on the internet. Besides the Pong game we
                made (which was the original assignment), I decided I wanted to make a space invaders like game with
                actual good-looking sprites.</p>

        <div class="aboutProjectsBox">
            <p class="aboutmefont">For the sprites I used PaintDotNet to make small 16 x 16 pixel art ships.
            I made 2 variants the Spanish and the British (sprites are shown down below). The enemies will shoot you and kill you.
            one shot from the enemy ship will kill you. Return fire with your own pirate ship to attempt to kill
            the spanish and british armada's.
                <br>
            The game spans over 5 levels. 2 of which contain their own unique ships, either the spanish or the british
            ships. the 3rd and 4th level have mixed enemies and level 5 is the boss level. The boss has 15 health points
            and can shoot multiple bullets at once.</p>
