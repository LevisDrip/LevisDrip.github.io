                I chose to learn more about Perlin Noise, the strange, random and almost static like texture that is used to make randomly
                generated maps.

                When making this game, I made all the assets myself. I decided to work with Voxel models, because I had just learned about
                a voxel model designer. Rigging the models for the enemies was a lot harder than I first anticipated but I was able to do it
                nonetheless!

            <p class="aboutmefont" id="projectMazeGame2">All the models you see are made by me. Some models were easy to make, while certain models such as the Robot Spider, were a bit more difficult. I was even able to animate the Robot Spider. Which was rather difficult because the modelling software I used wasn't able to rig the body parts together. So I had to do that within the Unity Editor. Like any Arachnid(Spider) I had to give the Spider joints, i did this by putting empty gameObjects wherever I wanted the spiders limbs to be able to turn. Truly a tedious process taking up most of my time, but they work and look pretty good if I say so myself
