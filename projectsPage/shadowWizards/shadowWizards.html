            <p class="aboutmefont" id="projectWizardInfo1">This is a game me and a friend of mine made for a small game jam at out school. We had 2 to 3 days to
                make a game with a of subject choice, these subject were given at the start of the game jam. We chose the subject
                space wizards. So this is what we came up with. A Galaga like space wizard shooter. The game's difficulty
                depends on the score. Every 4000 score adds a new enemy spawner. This means that at some point the game will
                be so difficult that you cant run it anymore.</p>

            <p class="aboutmefont" id="projectWizardInfo2">This game can be 2 player. As long as you have lives, which can be seen on the left side of the screen, a
                second player can join or if you have died you can respawn. The lives are global so every player can use it.
                The ghost enemies have a chance to drop 1ups and the tank enemie has a chance to drop "Mana potions" which, when picked up, will increase your rate of fire.

                At our school we have this arcade cabinet, or more or less a computer that has arcade controls. We thought it
                would be a funny idea to make this game compatible for the arcade cabinet. Luckily we were able to get out hands on the control sheets and thus we were able to make 2 versions of the game. One of them for computer
                and another for the arcade cabinet.</p>
