            <br>
            <p class="aboutmefont" id="information2">I am 17 years old and live in the Netherlands.
                 I am currently studying Software development at Sintlucas
                 in Eindhoven. Before my studies I used to go to Citaverde in Horst,
                 which was a school that didn't actually have anything to do with computers
                 so i basically just went there because it was a nice and small school.
                 I am currently studying for the cambridge exam on C1 level. Even though I've been
                 told my speaking is on C2 level, I find reading and understanding texts quite difficult.

            <p class="aboutmefont" id="information4">
                In my free time I like to play games with my friends. We would play games like Minecraft, Terraria
                and all sorts of party games in which we can just get mad at each other, because one of us is always
                luckier than the others. Other than playing games I also like playing guitar. I picked up playing
                the guitar not to long after making this website. A little dedication came a far way, because in less
                than half a year I was able to play some of my favorite songs! The first song I knew how to play was the intro theme to The last of us.

            <h5 class="aboutmefont" id="information5">My experience with programming</h5>
            <br>
            <p class="aboutmefont" id="information6">
                For the past years I have been programming stuff for school like games and websites. We started
                by learning the basics of HTML and CSS, after a while we got to learn Javascript as well.
                In the first period of the second year we had learned even more about web development, thus also got
                more efficient with JavaScript and CSS. That was in the same period that I made this website.
                In the second period we will start working on Game development which I am really excited about.
                <br>
                <br>
                I personally want to specialize in game development, since I think it's more fun than web development.
                In my first year of my education we made prototype games like a first-person shooter. I also made
                BlackJack for a freedom assignment. I would've made more, but we had too little time to make our game.
                As of now Unity has made some pretty bad business decisions, that's why I haven't made anything in Unity
                for quite a while, I'm looking into other engines at the moment as well, but I haven't found any yet.
                A friend of mine has his own Studio business called Story Studio Entertainment. He had requested me to
                make a game revolving around the fictional universe that he is currently creating. Together with a friend
                we decided to start working on that project. In the end, me and my friend hope to start our own game
                development company.
